        Hi all, I'm Seb, late thirty, guy who's passion is projecting everything
        what can be projected... btw I dont have single furniture bought from
        shop, all just made by myself.. sorry, office chair has been bought from

        I have worked in several professions in my live - gardener, miner (yeap
        :)), waiter, restaurant manager. I have always thought that you have to
        like what you do, especially if we spend most of the day in work. I
        alwyas wanted to create something thats why I started to learn CSS, Js,
        React and many others which I didn't even hear about a few years ago.
        When I got into it I knew that I want to turn it into a full-time job.
        We'll see what comes out...{' '}
