        I have worked in several professions in my live - gardener, waiter,
        miner, restaurant manager. I have always thought that you have to like
        what you do, especially if we spend most of the day in work. I alwyas
        wanted to create something thats why I started to learn CSS, Js, React
        and many others which I didn't even hear about a few years ago. When I
        got into it I knew that I want to turn it into a full-time job. We'll
        see what comes out...{' '}
