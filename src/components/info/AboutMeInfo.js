        I'm Seb, late thirty, guy whose passion is projecting everything what
        can be projected... btw I don't have single furniture bought from shop,

        I have worked in several professions in my live - gardener, miner (yeap
        :), waiter, restaurant manager. I have always thought that we have to
        like what we do, especially if we spend most of the day in work.

        I alwyas wanted to create something thats why I started to learn CSS,
        Js, React and many others which I didn't even hear about a few years
        ago. When I got into it I knew that I want to turn it into a full-time
        job.

      <p className='screen-text speech'>We'll see what comes out... </p>
